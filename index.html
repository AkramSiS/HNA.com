var flashcards = [
  { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-powered virtual characters used in social experiments, surveys, and interviews. They don’t just role-play; they can build profiles, remember past interactions, think about their behavior, and learn to make conversations more dynamic." },
  { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree counts the connections coming into a node (like how many followers you have), while outdegree counts the connections going out (like how many people you follow)." },
  { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality tells you how quickly a node can reach all other nodes. You add up the shortest distances from that node to all others and then take the inverse so that nodes closer to everyone score higher." },
  { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness centrality are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act like bridges, connecting different parts of the network and playing a key role in spreading information." },
  { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it considered a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "Degree centrality just counts the number of direct connections a node has, while eigenvector centrality also looks at how important or well-connected those neighbors are. This means a node with fewer, but more influential, connections can be more important overall." },
  { front: "6. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "Barabási found that many different networks, regardless of their age or purpose, tend to have similar overall structures. In other words, they share common patterns in how they’re built." },
  { front: "7. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "They are the Erdös–Rényi model (where nodes are connected randomly), the Small-world model (starting with a regular structure and then adding shortcuts), and the Barabasi-Albert model (which grows by adding new nodes that prefer to connect to popular ones)." },
  { front: "8. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "In the Gn,p model, you start with n nodes, and each possible pair of nodes gets connected with a fixed probability p, chosen completely at random." },
  { front: "9. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "The Gn,M model creates a graph with n nodes and exactly M edges. The graph is chosen at random from all possible graphs with these n nodes and M edges." },
  { front: "10. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures how well a network can be divided into groups or communities, where nodes within each group are more connected to each other than to those outside. This helps us see hidden structures like social circles." },
  { front: "11. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "The BA model works by two ideas: Growth, where the network gets bigger over time, and Preferential Attachment, where new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many connections." },
  { front: "12. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant to social network analysis?", back: "The friendship paradox is the observation that, on average, your friends tend to have more friends than you do. This happens because popular people show up in many friend lists, influencing how information spreads in a network." },
  { front: "13. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "These algorithms automatically find groups of nodes that stick together more than with the rest of the network, revealing hidden communities like friend circles." },
  { front: "14. What does the clustering coefficient measure in a network?", back: "It measures how likely it is that a node's neighbors are also connected to each other. A high clustering coefficient means the node is part of a tight-knit group." },
  { front: "15. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are nodes with many connections, acting like central intersections. They are crucial for keeping the network connected and for quickly spreading information." },
  { front: "16. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment means new nodes tend to link up with already popular nodes. This causes a few nodes to become super-connected hubs, while most nodes end up with only a few links." },
  { front: "17. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an Erdös–Rényi graph, the average number of steps to go from one node to another grows roughly with the logarithm of the total number of nodes, so even large networks have relatively short paths." },
  { front: "18. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "They have a binomial degree distribution, which means most nodes have a similar number of connections, with very few nodes having much more or much less than average." },
  { front: "19. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "Small-world networks keep strong local connections (high clustering) while adding a few random long-range links that act as shortcuts, so you can quickly move between different parts of the network." },
  { front: "20. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness is about how well a network continues to work when some nodes or links fail. A robust network stays connected even if parts of it break down." },
  { front: "21. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing the highly connected hubs can quickly break the network into separate pieces. This shows that while scale-free networks can handle random failures, they are very vulnerable if key hubs are targeted." },
  { front: "22. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the E-R Random Graph Model?", back: "No, fixing n and p doesn’t give you one specific graph. Instead, many different graphs can be created with the same n and p because each edge is added randomly." },
  { front: "23. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an Erdös–Rényi graph, each pair of neighbors has a probability p of being connected, which generally results in a low overall clustering in the network." },
  { front: "24. Compared to the E-R Random Graph Model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks like film actors and C. elegans?", back: "Real-world networks often have short paths between any two nodes and high clustering, meaning that nodes form tight groups." },
  { front: "25. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network according to the Watts-Strogatz model?", back: "The process starts with a regular network, such as a ring where each node connects to its immediate neighbors. This setup has high clustering but also long paths between distant nodes." },
  { front: "26. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model and what is its purpose?", back: "During rewiring, each edge has a chance to be randomly reconnected to a different node, creating shortcuts that significantly reduce the distance between nodes." },
  { front: "27. What happens to the Small-world network when the rewire probability (pr) is 0? What happens when pr is 1?", back: "If pr is 0, no edges are rewired, so the network remains regular. If pr is 1, every edge is randomly rewired, turning the network into one similar to an Erdös–Rényi random graph." },
  { front: "28. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and small average shortest path length?", back: "It starts with a regular network with tight groups (high clustering) and then adds a few random shortcuts that make it much quicker to travel between any two nodes." },
  { front: "29. What type of degree distribution is typical for both E-R and Small-world networks?", back: "Both models usually show a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections close to the average, with very few nodes having extreme values." },
  { front: "30. What is a key observation about the degree distribution of many real-world networks that is not captured by the E-R or Small-world models?", back: "In many real networks, only a few nodes (hubs) have lots of connections, while most nodes have very few. It’s like a party where only a few people are super popular, and the rest have just a few friends—a pattern described by a power law." },
  { front: "31. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "The BA model creates a scale-free network, meaning it naturally forms a few highly connected hubs alongside many nodes with fewer connections." },
  { front: "32. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "In BA scale-free networks, the number of connections per node follows a power law. This means most nodes have few links, while a few hubs have many links, usually with an exponent around 3." },
  { front: "33. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "BA scale-free networks tend to have very short average path lengths – even shorter than random graphs – making it very easy to travel from one node to another. That's why they're called 'ultra small world' networks." },
  { front: "34. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks in real-world systems?", back: "The controversy is that 'scale-free' isn’t clearly defined, and many real-world networks might not perfectly follow the expected power law pattern. Sometimes other models, like a log-normal distribution, fit the data better." },
  { front: "35. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "The BA/SF model is meant to show how networks can naturally develop a few very connected nodes (hubs) over time. It’s more about explaining the process than exactly modeling a specific network." },
  { front: "36. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment in network growth models?", back: "In linear preferential attachment, a new node’s chance to connect to an existing node is directly proportional to that node’s current connections. In non-linear attachment, this relationship is adjusted, which can change the number and size of hubs." },
  { front: "37. What are some modifications or variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world network properties?", back: "Improvements include using non-linear preferential attachment (changing how strongly connections matter), setting a maximum limit on connections (degree cutoff), giving new nodes a boost (age correction), and considering that nodes usually connect more within local areas (local-world models)." }
