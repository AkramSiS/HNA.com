  // Network Metrics and Basics
  { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-powered virtual characters used in social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can build profiles, remember past interactions, reflect on their behavior, and learn to make conversations more dynamic." },
  { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree counts the connections coming into a node (like how many followers you have), while outdegree counts the connections going out (like how many people you follow)." },
  { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality tells you how quickly a node can reach all other nodes. You sum the shortest distances from that node to everyone else and then take the inverse; nodes with lower total distances score higher." },
  { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node sits on the shortest path between two other nodes. High-betweenness nodes act as bridges, connecting different parts of the network and facilitating the spread of information." },
  { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it seen as a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "While degree centrality simply counts how many direct connections a node has, eigenvector centrality also considers the importance of the nodes it’s connected to. A node with fewer but more influential connections can be more significant overall." },
  { front: "6. What is the difference between a directed and an undirected network?", back: "In a directed network, connections have a direction (like Twitter follows), meaning the relationships are one-way. In an undirected network, connections are mutual (like Facebook friendships), so the relationship is two-way." },
  { front: "7. What does the size of a network refer to?", back: "The size of a network is the total number of nodes (or vertices) it contains." },
  { front: "8. What is network density and how is it calculated?", back: "Density = (number of edges) / (maximum possible number of edges). For an undirected network with n nodes, maximum edges = n(n – 1)/2. It shows how ‘full’ or connected the network is." },
  { front: "9. What is the clustering coefficient of a node?", back: "It measures how connected a node’s neighbors are among themselves. It’s calculated as (number of actual connections between neighbors) divided by (maximum possible connections among them)." },
  { front: "10. What is the global clustering coefficient of a network?", back: "It’s the average clustering coefficient of all nodes, reflecting the overall tendency of nodes to form tight-knit groups." },
  { front: "11. What is the best seeding strategy for simple contagion diffusion?", back: "For simple contagion, the optimal strategy is to target the most central nodes that are spread out across the network (different hubs) so that each seed can reach a unique set of contacts quickly." },
  
  // Core Network Theory & Models
  { front: "12. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "He discovered that many networks, regardless of age or purpose, tend to share similar overall structures and common patterns in their connectivity." },
  { front: "13. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "They are the Erdös–Rényi (ER) model (where edges are formed randomly), the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model (which starts with a regular network and adds random shortcuts), and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model (which grows via preferential attachment, favoring nodes with high degrees)." },
  { front: "14. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "In the Gn,p model, you begin with n nodes and connect each possible pair with a fixed probability p. Each edge is added completely at random." },
  { front: "15. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "The Gn,M model selects one graph uniformly at random from all graphs with n nodes and exactly M edges." },
  { front: "16. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures how well a network can be divided into clusters or communities where nodes are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. It helps reveal hidden social structures." },
  { front: "17. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "The BA model is based on Growth (adding new nodes over time) and Preferential Attachment (new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many connections), leading to the formation of hubs." },
  { front: "18. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant?", back: "The friendship paradox is the phenomenon where, on average, your friends have more friends than you do, mainly because popular individuals appear in many friend lists and influence information spread." },
  { front: "19. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They automatically identify clusters or communities within the network—groups of nodes that are more interconnected with each other than with the rest of the network." },
  { front: "20. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are highly connected nodes that act as central intersections in the network, playing a crucial role in maintaining connectivity and rapidly propagating information." },
  { front: "21. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment means that new nodes are more likely to connect with nodes that already have many connections. This process creates a network with few highly connected hubs and many nodes with fewer links." },
  { front: "22. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "It’s the average number of steps needed to connect any two nodes, and in an ER graph, this number grows roughly with the logarithm of the number of nodes, keeping paths short even in large networks." },
  { front: "23. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "ER graphs exhibit a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections close to the average, with few nodes having extremely high or low degrees." },
  { front: "24. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "They maintain high local clustering (dense connections within neighborhoods) while introducing a few random long-range links (shortcuts) that significantly reduce the path lengths between distant nodes." },
  { front: "25. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness is the capacity of a network to stay connected even if some nodes or links fail, ensuring that the network continues to function under stress." },
  { front: "26. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing hubs can quickly fragment a scale-free network into isolated clusters, demonstrating that such networks are highly vulnerable to targeted attacks even though they are resilient to random failures." },
  { front: "27. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the ER model?", back: "No. Even with fixed values of n and p, many different graphs can be formed because each potential edge is added at random." },
  { front: "28. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an ER graph?", back: "Since any two neighbors have a probability p of being connected, the local clustering coefficient in ER graphs tends to be low overall." },
  { front: "29. Compared to the ER model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks?", back: "Real-world networks often exhibit short path lengths between nodes and high clustering, meaning they have tight groups despite being large in size." },
  { front: "30. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network (Watts-Strogatz model)?", back: "It starts with a regular network, such as a ring lattice where each node is connected to its nearest neighbors, which naturally has high clustering and long path lengths." },
  { front: "31. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz model and its purpose?", back: "During rewiring, each edge has a chance to be reconnected to a random node. This creates shortcuts that reduce the overall path lengths while largely preserving the network’s clustering." },
  { front: "32. What happens to a Small-world network when the rewiring probability (pr) is 0 or 1?", back: "If pr is 0, no edges are rewired and the network remains a regular lattice. If pr is 1, all edges are rewired randomly, making the network similar to an ER random graph." },
  { front: "33. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and a small average path length?", back: "By starting with a regular, highly clustered network and then adding a few random shortcuts, the model drastically reduces the number of steps needed to connect any two nodes." },
  { front: "34. What type of degree distribution is typical for both ER and Small-world networks?", back: "Both models typically have a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections near the average value." },
  { front: "35. What is a key observation about the degree distribution in many real networks that ER and Small-world models don’t capture?", back: "Real networks often have a few hubs with many connections while most nodes have very few—a pattern that follows a power law distribution." },
  { front: "36. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "The BA model produces a scale-free network characterized by a few highly connected hubs alongside many nodes with fewer connections." },
  { front: "37. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "It follows a power law, meaning that while most nodes have few connections, a few hubs have many links, typically with an exponent around 3." },
  { front: "38. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "BA scale-free networks often feature extremely short average path lengths—sometimes even shorter than those of random graphs—making them 'ultra small world' networks." },
  { front: "39. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks?", back: "The controversy is that 'scale-free' is not clearly defined, and many real-world networks may not perfectly follow a power law; in some cases, other models like the log-normal distribution provide a better fit." },
  { front: "40. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "The BA/SF model is designed to explain how networks can naturally develop a few very connected hubs over time rather than to precisely model a particular real-world network." },
  { front: "41. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment?", back: "In linear preferential attachment, a new node’s probability to connect is directly proportional to a node’s existing connections. In non-linear attachment, this relationship is modified, which affects the number and size of hubs." },
  { front: "42. What are some variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world properties?", back: "Variants include using non-linear preferential attachment, imposing degree cutoffs, incorporating age effects, and focusing on local connections (local-world models)." },
  
  // Diffusion, Contagion, and Social Ties
  { front: "43. Simple Contagion", back: "A contagion where a single contact is enough for transmission—like catching a cold. It typically spreads via weak ties." },
  { front: "44. Complex Contagion", back: "A contagion that requires reinforcement from multiple credible contacts before it spreads—common in behavior change or social movements, often relying on strong ties." },
  { front: "45. Weak Ties", back: "These are connections with acquaintances, distant friends, or colleagues. They occur infrequently but are valuable for discovering new information, such as job leads." },
  { front: "46. Strong Ties", back: "Close relationships like those with family, close friends, or partners. These ties are frequent, supportive, and usually form a tight-knit group." },
  { front: "47. \"The Strength of Weak Ties\"", back: "A concept by Mark Granovetter (1973) showing that weak ties are often valuable for accessing new information because they bridge different social circles." },
  { front: "48. Diffusion Models", back: "Mathematical models used to explain how information or diseases spread through networks. Examples include the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." },
  { front: "49. Independent Cascade Model (IC Model)", back: "A model for simple contagion where nodes are either active or inactive. Once a node becomes active, it gets one chance to activate each neighbor with a given probability." },
  { front: "50. Seed Nodes", back: "These are the initially activated nodes in a diffusion process that kick-start the spread of information or contagion." },
  { front: "51. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model", back: "A model where individuals can be in one of three states: Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered. Susceptible individuals get infected, and after a while, infected ones recover." },
  { front: "52. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) Model", back: "A variant of the SIR model that adds an Exposed stage for those infected but not yet contagious, often used to model diseases like COVID-19." },
  { front: "53. Threshold Model", back: "A model for complex contagion where an individual adopts a behavior only if a certain number or fraction of their contacts have already done so." },
  { front: "54. Absolute Threshold", back: "A threshold model in which an individual needs a specific number of their neighbors (T) to have adopted a behavior before they do." },
  { front: "55. Linear Threshold Model", back: "A version of the threshold model where each neighbor’s influence is weighted, and a node adopts a behavior if the total weighted influence exceeds a preset threshold." },
  { front: "56. Width of a Bridge", back: "This is the number of overlapping ties between two communities. A wider bridge means more shared connections, which aids in the spread of complex behaviors." },
  { front: "57. Social Tipping Point", back: "The point in a diffusion process when a behavior or idea begins to spread on its own, becoming self-sustaining." },
  { front: "58. Critical Mass", back: "The minimum portion of a population needed for a behavior or idea to spread widely. Estimates vary, often around 16%, but sometimes between 5% and 40%." },
  { front: "59. How do viruses and information spread in social networks?", back: "They typically spread through simple contagion, where a single contact can trigger transmission, often aided by weak ties." },
  { front: "60. How do social change and risky behaviors spread in social networks?", back: "They usually spread via complex contagion, which requires reinforcement from multiple, strong, and reliable connections before adoption." },
  { front: "61. Can we capture the principles of contagion processes in numerical models?", back: "Yes—by understanding the contagion mechanism and setting the key parameters, we can simulate these processes using models like the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." },
  
  // Calculation Examples
  { front: "62. How do you calculate network density? Provide an example.", back: "Density = (number of edges) / (maximum possible edges). For an undirected network with 10 nodes, maximum edges = 10×9/2 = 45. If there are 8 edges, density = 8/45 ≈ 0.178." },
  { front: "63. How do you calculate the clustering coefficient of a node? Provide an example.", back: "Clustering coefficient = (actual connections among neighbors) / (maximum possible connections among them). For instance, if node A has 3 neighbors, maximum connections = 3; if none are connected, the coefficient is 0." },
  { front: "64. How do you calculate the global clustering coefficient of a network? Provide an example.", back: "The global clustering coefficient is the average of all nodes’ clustering coefficients or computed as (3 × number of triangles) / (number of connected triplets). If most nodes have a coefficient of 0, the global value will be 0." },
  { front: "65. How do you calculate the maximum possible number of edges in an undirected network? Provide an example.", back: "For n nodes, maximum edges = n(n – 1)/2. For example, if n = 10, maximum edges = 10×9/2 = 45." },
  { front: "66. How do you calculate the average shortest path length of a network? Provide an example.", back: "Calculate the shortest path between every pair of nodes, sum these lengths, and divide by the number of pairs. For instance, if the total is 100 for 45 pairs (10 nodes), the average path length = 100/45 ≈ 2.222." },
  
  // Additional Topics: Clustered vs. Small-World, IMP, and Related Strategies
  { front: "67. What are the key characteristics distinguishing clustered networks from small-world networks?", back: "Clustered networks have high clustering without weak ties or shortcuts, whereas small-world networks also have high clustering but include a few weak ties that serve as shortcuts." },
  { front: "68. How do simple and complex contagion differ in terms of network structure and spread?", back: "Simple contagion spreads quickly in random or small-world networks and can be boosted by hubs. Complex contagion, however, relies on strong ties and may start with less-central, peripheral actors, requiring multiple confirmations before adoption." },
  { front: "69. What are some social network-based strategies mentioned for containing COVID-19?", back: "Strategies include social distancing, forming social bubbles, 'seek similarity' by interacting with geographically or demographically similar individuals, and 'strengthen community' by maintaining contact within cohesive groups." },
  { front: "70. What is the core objective of the Influence Maximization Problem (IMP)?", back: "The main goal of IMP is to identify a small set of influential nodes (seed set S) that, when activated, maximize the spread of influence across the network." },
  { front: "71. What is the distinction between Structural IMP and Functional IMP?", back: "In Structural IMP, the influence function depends solely on the network’s topology (its connectivity and structure), whereas in Functional IMP, the influence function also accounts for how influence actually spreads (the contagion mechanism)."},
  { front: "72. Name some common centrality heuristics used to approximate solutions for the Influence Maximization Problem.", back: "Common heuristics include degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, k-core, and eigenvector centrality." },
  { front: "73. Briefly describe the greedy algorithm approach for Influence Maximization.", back: "The greedy algorithm starts with an empty seed set and, at each step, adds the node that yields the largest increase in influence, repeating until the desired number of seed nodes is reached." },
  { front: "74. What is the main advantage of the Cost-Effective Lazy Forward (CELF) algorithm compared to the standard greedy algorithm for IMP?", back: "CELF reduces computational time by taking advantage of the submodular property of the influence function, so it avoids re-evaluating every node’s marginal gain at each step." }
