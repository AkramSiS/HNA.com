      { front: "What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-driven agents used for social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can create profiles, retain memory, reflect, and learn from interactions, enabling dynamic social simulations." },
      { front: "Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree is the number of incoming edges (e.g., number of followers on Twitter), while outdegree is the number of outgoing edges (e.g., number of people you follow)." },
      { front: "Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all others by summing the shortest path distances and taking the inverse." },
      { front: "Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness centrality are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. High values indicate key bridges that control information flow." },
      { front: "How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it considered a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "Degree centrality counts direct connections, whereas eigenvector centrality prioritizes connections to influential nodes, making it a better measure of overall influence." },
      { front: "What does the local clustering coefficient measure, and what does a high clustering coefficient indicate about a node's network?", back: "It measures how likely a node's neighbors are connected. A high coefficient suggests a tightly-knit community." },
      { front: "What are the three mechanisms that explain transitivity tendency in a social network?", back: "Meeting opportunities, homophily (preference for similar individuals), and structural balance (people prefer balanced social relationships)." },
      { front: "Define modularity in the context of network analysis and explain what a high modularity value signifies.", back: "Modularity measures the strength of network division into communities. A high value indicates well-defined, separate communities with strong internal connections." },
      { front: "What are the key differences between Watts-Strogatz and Barabási-Albert models?", back: "Watts-Strogatz explains small-world networks with high clustering and short path lengths, while Barabási-Albert models scale-free networks where a few nodes become highly connected hubs through preferential attachment." },
      { front: "What is network robustness, and how does it relate to scale-free networks?", back: "Network robustness refers to the ability to withstand node failures. Scale-free networks are resilient to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks on hubs." },
      { front: "What is the epidemic threshold in network analysis, and why do scale-free networks often lack one?", back: "The epidemic threshold is the point at which an infection can spread widely. Scale-free networks often lack a threshold due to the presence of highly connected hubs." },
      { front: "What are the main applications of social network analysis?", back: "Applications include disease modeling, marketing and influence maximization, recommendation systems, cybersecurity, and organizational analysis." }
