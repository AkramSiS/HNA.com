  // Network Metrics and Basics
  { front: "1. What is the difference between a directed and an undirected network?", back: "In a directed network, each connection has a direction (like Twitter follows, where A may follow B without reciprocation), while in an undirected network, connections are mutual (like Facebook friendships where both parties are connected)." },
  { front: "2. What does the size of a network refer to?", back: "The size of a network is the total number of nodes (or vertices) it contains." },
  { front: "3. What is network density and how is it calculated?", back: "Network density is the ratio of the actual number of connections to the maximum possible number of connections. It tells you how closely connected the network is." },
  { front: "4. What is the clustering coefficient of a node?", back: "It measures the extent to which a node’s neighbors are also connected to each other, compared to how many connections could possibly exist among them." },
  { front: "5. What is the global clustering coefficient of a network?", back: "It is the average clustering coefficient across all nodes in the network, reflecting the overall tendency of nodes to form tight-knit groups." },
  { front: "6. What is the best seeding strategy for simple contagion diffusion?", back: "For simple contagion, you should target the most central nodes that are spread across different parts (hubs) of the network. This way, each chosen node can quickly reach a unique set of contacts." },
  
  // Core Network Theory & Models
  { front: "7. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-powered virtual characters used in social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can build profiles, remember past interactions, reflect on their behavior, and learn to make conversations more dynamic." },
  { front: "8. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree is the number of incoming connections (like the number of followers you have), while outdegree is the number of outgoing connections (like the number of people you follow)." },
  { front: "9. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality indicates how quickly a node can reach all other nodes. It’s calculated by summing the shortest distances from that node to every other node, then taking the inverse—nodes with lower total distances score higher." },
  { front: "10. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act as bridges, connecting different parts of the network and facilitating the flow of information." },
  { front: "11. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it seen as a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "While degree centrality counts direct connections, eigenvector centrality also takes into account the importance of the connected nodes. So, a node connected to influential nodes can be more important even if it has fewer connections overall." },
  { front: "12. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "He discovered that many networks, regardless of their age, purpose, or function, tend to share similar overall structures and common patterns in how they’re built." },
  { front: "13. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "They are the Erdös–Rényi (ER) model (where connections are made randomly), the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model (which starts with a regular network and adds shortcuts), and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model (which grows via preferential attachment, favoring popular nodes)." },
  { front: "14. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "In the Gn,p model, you start with n nodes, and each possible pair of nodes is connected with a fixed probability p, with each connection made completely at random." },
  { front: "15. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "In the Gn,M model, a graph is chosen uniformly at random from all possible graphs with n nodes and exactly M edges." },
  { front: "16. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures how well a network can be divided into communities, where nodes are more densely connected within groups than between groups. It helps reveal hidden structures like social circles." },
  { front: "17. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "The BA model relies on Growth (the network expands as new nodes are added) and Preferential Attachment (new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes that already have many connections, creating hubs)." },
  { front: "18. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant?", back: "The friendship paradox is the idea that on average, your friends have more friends than you do, because popular individuals tend to appear in many people’s friend lists, affecting how information spreads." },
  { front: "19. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They automatically identify groups or clusters of nodes that interact more frequently with each other than with the rest of the network, revealing hidden community structures." },
  { front: "20. What does the clustering coefficient measure in a network?", back: "It measures the likelihood that a node’s neighbors are also connected, indicating the presence of closely-knit groups." },
  { front: "21. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are highly connected nodes that serve as central intersections. They play a critical role in keeping the network connected and in rapidly spreading information." },
  { front: "22. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment means that new nodes tend to link to already popular nodes. This creates a few super-connected hubs, while most nodes have relatively few connections." },
  { front: "23. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an ER graph, the average distance between any two nodes grows roughly with the logarithm of the total number of nodes, keeping paths short even in large networks." },
  { front: "24. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "They exhibit a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections close to the average, with very few nodes having extremely high or low degrees." },
  { front: "25. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "They maintain high local clustering (strong local connections) while introducing a few random long-range links (shortcuts) that greatly reduce the number of steps between distant nodes." },
  { front: "26. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness refers to the ability of a network to remain connected even when some nodes or links fail, ensuring the system continues to function under stress." },
  { front: "27. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing hubs can quickly fragment the network into isolated pieces, showing that while scale-free networks are resistant to random failures, they are vulnerable to targeted attacks on key nodes." },
  { front: "28. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the ER model?", back: "No. Although n and p set the conditions, many different graphs can be generated because each connection is formed randomly." },
  { front: "29. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an Erdös–Rényi graph?", back: "Since any two neighbors are connected with probability p, the local clustering coefficient tends to be low in ER graphs." },
  { front: "30. Compared to the ER model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks?", back: "Real-world networks often feature short path lengths between nodes and high clustering, meaning nodes tend to form tight groups." },
  { front: "31. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network (Watts-Strogatz model)?", back: "It starts with a regular network, like a ring lattice where each node connects to its nearest neighbors, which naturally has high clustering and long path lengths." },
  { front: "32. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz model and its purpose?", back: "In the rewiring step, each edge has a chance to be reconnected to a random node, creating shortcuts that dramatically reduce path lengths while largely preserving clustering." },
  { front: "33. What happens to a Small-world network when the rewiring probability (pr) is 0 or 1?", back: "If pr is 0, no edges are rewired and the network remains a regular lattice. If pr is 1, all edges are rewired randomly, making it similar to an ER random graph." },
  { front: "34. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and a small average path length?", back: "By starting with a regular network (high clustering) and adding just a few random shortcuts, it drastically reduces the number of steps between any two nodes." },
  { front: "35. What type of degree distribution is typical for both ER and Small-world networks?", back: "Both typically show a binomial degree distribution, where most nodes have a number of connections close to the average." },
  { front: "36. What is a key observation about the degree distribution in many real networks that ER and Small-world models don’t capture?", back: "In many real networks, only a few nodes (hubs) have a very large number of connections while most have very few—a pattern that follows a power law." },
  { front: "37. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "The BA model produces a scale-free network characterized by a few highly connected hubs and many nodes with few connections." },
  { front: "38. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "It follows a power law distribution, meaning that while most nodes have few links, a few hubs have many connections, typically with an exponent around 3." },
  { front: "39. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "BA scale-free networks often have very short average path lengths—even shorter than random graphs—making them 'ultra small world' networks." },
  { front: "40. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks?", back: "The controversy is that 'scale-free' isn’t clearly defined and many real networks may not perfectly follow a power law; other distributions like log-normal can sometimes better describe the data." },
  { front: "41. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "It is intended to explain how networks naturally develop a few very connected hubs over time, rather than to exactly model a specific real-world network." },
  { front: "42. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment?", back: "In linear preferential attachment, the chance of a new node connecting is directly proportional to the number of existing connections. In non-linear attachment, this relationship is modified, which can change how hubs form." },
  { front: "43. What are some variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world properties?", back: "Variants include using non-linear preferential attachment, setting limits on maximum connections (degree cutoffs), incorporating age effects (age correction), and focusing on local attachment (local-world models)." },
  
  // Diffusion, Contagion, and Social Ties
  { front: "44. Simple Contagion", back: "A contagion where a single contact is enough for transmission—like catching a cold. It usually spreads through weak ties." },
  { front: "45. Complex Contagion", back: "A contagion that requires reinforcement from multiple, credible contacts before it spreads—common in behavior change or joining social movements, often relying on strong ties." },
  { front: "46. Weak Ties", back: "Connections with acquaintances, distant friends, or colleagues that occur infrequently but can provide new information, like job leads." },
  { front: "47. Strong Ties", back: "Close relationships such as with family, close friends, or partners where interactions are frequent and supportive, often forming a tight-knit group." },
  { front: "48. \"The Strength of Weak Ties\"", back: "A concept by Mark Granovetter (1973) showing that weak ties are valuable for accessing new information because they bridge different social circles." },
  { front: "49. Diffusion Models", back: "Mathematical models used to explain how information or diseases spread through networks. Examples include the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." },
  { front: "50. Independent Cascade Model (IC Model)", back: "A model for simple contagion where nodes can be active or inactive. Once activated, a node gets one chance to activate each neighbor with a given probability." },
  { front: "51. Seed Nodes", back: "The initially activated nodes in a diffusion process that kick-start the spread of information or contagion." },
  { front: "52. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model", back: "A model where individuals are either Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered. Susceptible individuals can get infected, and then eventually recover." },
  { front: "53. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) Model", back: "A variant of the SIR model that includes an Exposed stage for those infected but not yet contagious, often used for modeling diseases like COVID-19." },
  { front: "54. Threshold Model", back: "A model for complex contagion where a person adopts a behavior only if a certain number or fraction of their contacts have already done so." },
  { front: "55. Absolute Threshold", back: "A threshold model where an individual needs a specific number of neighbors (T) to adopt a behavior before they do so themselves." },
  { front: "56. Linear Threshold Model", back: "A version of the threshold model where each neighbor’s influence is weighted, and a node adopts a behavior if the total influence exceeds a preset threshold." },
  { front: "57. Width of a Bridge", back: "The number of overlapping ties between two communities. Wider bridges mean more shared connections, which helps in spreading complex behaviors across groups." },
  { front: "58. Social Tipping Point", back: "The moment in a diffusion process when a behavior or idea starts to spread on its own without needing extra external push." },
  { front: "59. Critical Mass", back: "The minimum fraction of a population required for a behavior or idea to spread widely. Estimates vary, often around 16% but sometimes between 5% and 40%." },
  { front: "60. How do viruses and information spread in social networks?", back: "They generally spread through simple contagion, where a single contact can trigger transmission, often aided by weak ties." },
  { front: "61. How do social change and risky behaviors spread in social networks?", back: "They usually spread through complex contagion, requiring reinforcement from multiple strong, reliable contacts before adoption occurs." },
  { front: "62. Can we capture the principles of contagion processes in numerical models?", back: "Yes, by understanding the contagion mechanism and setting key parameters, we can simulate these processes using models like the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." }
