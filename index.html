  // Network Metrics and Basics
  { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-powered virtual characters used in social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can build profiles, remember past interactions, reflect on their behavior, and learn to make conversations more dynamic." },
  { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree counts the connections coming into a node (like how many followers you have), while outdegree counts the connections going out (like how many people you follow)." },
  { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality tells you how quickly a node can reach all other nodes. You add up the shortest distances from that node to everyone else and then take the inverse—nodes with lower total distances score higher." },
  { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node sits on the shortest path between two other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act like bridges, connecting different parts of the network and helping spread information." },
  { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it seen as a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "While degree centrality simply counts direct connections, eigenvector centrality also considers the importance of the connected nodes. So, a node with fewer but influential connections can be more important overall." },
  { front: "6. What is the difference between a directed and an undirected network?", back: "In a directed network, connections have a direction (like one-way streets or Twitter follows), while in an undirected network, connections are mutual (like Facebook friendships)." },
  { front: "7. What does the size of a network refer to?", back: "The size of a network is the total number of nodes (or vertices) it contains." },
  { front: "8. What is network density and how is it calculated?", back: "Density measures how many edges exist relative to the maximum possible number. For an undirected network with n nodes, maximum edges = n(n – 1)/2. It shows how 'full' or connected the network is." },
  { front: "9. What is the clustering coefficient of a node?", back: "It measures the extent to which a node’s neighbors are connected to each other. It's calculated as the number of actual connections between the neighbors divided by the maximum possible connections among them." },
  { front: "10. What is the global clustering coefficient of a network?", back: "It is the average of all nodes’ local clustering coefficients, reflecting the overall tendency of nodes to form tight-knit groups." },
  { front: "11. What is the best seeding strategy for simple contagion diffusion?", back: "For simple contagion, target the most central nodes spread across different parts of the network (different hubs), as they can reach many unique contacts quickly." },
  
  // Core Network Theory & Models
  { front: "12. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "He found that many networks, no matter their age or purpose, tend to have similar overall structures—common patterns appear in how they are built." },
  { front: "13. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "They are the Erdös–Rényi (ER) random graph model (random connections), the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model (regular structure with shortcuts), and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model (growth by preferential attachment)." },
  { front: "14. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "In the Gn,p model, start with n nodes and connect each possible pair with a fixed probability p, making each edge independently random." },
  { front: "15. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "The Gn,M model creates a graph with n nodes and exactly M edges, chosen uniformly at random from all possible graphs with those n nodes and M edges." },
  { front: "16. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures how well a network can be divided into communities, where nodes are more connected within groups than between them. It helps reveal structures like social circles." },
  { front: "17. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "The BA model uses Growth (adding new nodes over time) and Preferential Attachment (new nodes prefer connecting to already well-connected nodes), leading to hubs." },
  { front: "18. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant?", back: "The friendship paradox is the idea that on average, your friends have more friends than you do—because popular people show up in many friend lists, influencing how information spreads." },
  { front: "19. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They automatically find groups of nodes that interact more with each other than with the rest of the network, revealing hidden communities." },
  { front: "20. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are nodes with many connections that serve as central intersections, playing a key role in keeping the network connected and in spreading information quickly." },
  { front: "21. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment means new nodes are more likely to connect with already popular nodes, creating a few super-connected hubs while most nodes have fewer connections." },
  { front: "22. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an ER graph, the average number of steps between nodes grows roughly with the logarithm of the total nodes, so even large networks have relatively short paths." },
  { front: "23. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "ER graphs show a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections close to the average, with few extremes." },
  { front: "24. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "They maintain high local clustering (tight local connections) while adding a few random long-range links (shortcuts) that reduce the number of steps between distant nodes." },
  { front: "25. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness is the ability of a network to stay connected even when some nodes or links fail, ensuring the system still functions under stress." },
  { front: "26. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing hubs can quickly break the network into isolated pieces, showing that while scale-free networks handle random failures well, they’re vulnerable to targeted attacks." },
  { front: "27. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the ER model?", back: "No. Even with fixed n and p, many different graphs can be generated because each edge is formed randomly." },
  { front: "28. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an ER graph?", back: "Since any two neighbors are connected with probability p, ER graphs tend to have low local clustering coefficients overall." },
  { front: "29. Compared to the ER model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks?", back: "Real-world networks often have short path lengths and high clustering, meaning nodes tend to form tight groups." },
  { front: "30. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network (Watts-Strogatz model)?", back: "It starts with a regular network (like a ring lattice where each node connects to its nearest neighbors), which has high clustering and long path lengths." },
  { front: "31. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz model and its purpose?", back: "During rewiring, each edge has a chance to be reconnected to a random node, creating shortcuts that reduce path lengths while largely preserving clustering." },
  { front: "32. What happens to a Small-world network when the rewiring probability (pr) is 0 or 1?", back: "If pr is 0, no edges are rewired and the network remains a regular lattice. If pr is 1, all edges are rewired randomly, making it similar to an ER random graph." },
  { front: "33. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and a small average path length?", back: "It starts with a regular network (high clustering) and adds a few random shortcuts, drastically reducing the number of steps between nodes." },
  { front: "34. What type of degree distribution is typical for both ER and Small-world networks?", back: "Both typically show a binomial degree distribution, where most nodes have a number of connections close to the average." },
  { front: "35. What is a key observation about the degree distribution in many real networks that ER and Small-world models don’t capture?", back: "Many real networks have a few hubs with many connections while most nodes have very few—this follows a power law distribution." },
  { front: "36. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "The BA model produces a scale-free network characterized by a few highly connected hubs and many nodes with few connections." },
  { front: "37. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "It follows a power law, meaning most nodes have few links while a few hubs have many connections, typically with an exponent around 3." },
  { front: "38. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "BA scale-free networks often have very short average path lengths—even shorter than random graphs—making them 'ultra small world' networks." },
  { front: "39. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks?", back: "The controversy is that 'scale-free' isn’t clearly defined, and many real networks may not perfectly follow a power law; sometimes other models (like log-normal) fit better." },
  { front: "40. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "It’s meant to explain how networks naturally develop a few very connected hubs over time, rather than precisely modeling a specific real network." },
  { front: "41. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment?", back: "In linear attachment, a new node’s chance to connect is directly proportional to existing connections. In non-linear attachment, this relationship is modified, affecting how hubs form." },
  { front: "42. What are some variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world properties?", back: "Variants include using non-linear preferential attachment, imposing degree cutoffs, incorporating age effects, and focusing on local attachment (local-world models)." },
  
  // Diffusion, Contagion, and Social Ties
  { front: "43. Simple Contagion", back: "A contagion where a single contact is enough for transmission—like catching a cold. It typically spreads via weak ties." },
  { front: "44. Complex Contagion", back: "A contagion that requires reinforcement from multiple credible contacts before it spreads—common in behavior change or social movements, often relying on strong ties." },
  { front: "45. Weak Ties", back: "Connections with acquaintances, distant friends, or colleagues. They occur less frequently but are great for discovering new information, like job leads." },
  { front: "46. Strong Ties", back: "Close relationships such as with family, close friends, or partners. These ties are frequent and supportive, typically forming a tight-knit group." },
  { front: "47. \"The Strength of Weak Ties\"", back: "A concept by Mark Granovetter (1973) showing that weak ties are valuable for accessing new information because they bridge different social circles." },
  { front: "48. Diffusion Models", back: "Mathematical models used to explain how information or diseases spread in networks. Examples include the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." },
  { front: "49. Independent Cascade Model (IC Model)", back: "A model for simple contagion where nodes can be active or inactive. Once activated, a node gets one chance to activate each neighbor with a given probability." },
  { front: "50. Seed Nodes", back: "The initially activated nodes in a diffusion process that kick-start the spread of information or contagion." },
  { front: "51. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model", back: "A model where individuals are either Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered. Susceptible individuals can get infected, and infected ones eventually recover." },
  { front: "52. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) Model", back: "A variant of the SIR model that includes an Exposed stage for those infected but not yet contagious, often used for diseases like COVID-19." },
  { front: "53. Threshold Model", back: "A model for complex contagion where a person adopts a behavior only if a certain number or fraction of their contacts have already done so." },
  { front: "54. Absolute Threshold", back: "A threshold model where an individual needs a specific number of neighbors (T) to adopt a behavior before they do so." },
  { front: "55. Linear Threshold Model", back: "A version of the threshold model where each neighbor’s influence is weighted, and a node adopts a behavior if the total weight exceeds a preset threshold." },
  { front: "56. Width of a Bridge", back: "The number of overlapping ties between two communities. A wider bridge means more shared connections, which helps in spreading complex behaviors." },
  { front: "57. Social Tipping Point", back: "The moment in a diffusion process when a behavior or idea starts spreading on its own, becoming self-sustaining." },
  { front: "58. Critical Mass", back: "The minimum fraction of a population required for a behavior or idea to spread widely. Estimates vary, often around 16% but sometimes between 5% and 40%." },
  { front: "59. How do viruses and information spread in social networks?", back: "They generally spread through simple contagion, where a single contact can trigger transmission, often aided by weak ties." },
  { front: "60. How do social change and risky behaviors spread in social networks?", back: "They usually spread through complex contagion, requiring reinforcement from multiple strong, reliable contacts before adoption." },
  { front: "61. Can we capture the principles of contagion processes in numerical models?", back: "Yes—by understanding the contagion mechanism and setting key parameters, we can simulate these processes using models like the Independent Cascade, SIR, and Threshold models." },
  
  // Calculation Examples
  { front: "62. How do you calculate network density? Provide an example.", back: "Density = (number of edges) / (maximum possible number of edges). For an undirected network with 10 nodes, the maximum number of edges = 10 × 9 / 2 = 45. If there are 8 edges, then density = 8/45 ≈ 0.178." },
  { front: "63. How do you calculate the clustering coefficient of a node? Provide an example.", back: "Clustering coefficient = (actual connections among a node’s neighbors) / (maximum possible connections among them). For example, if node A has 3 neighbors, the maximum connections among them = 3. If none are connected, A’s clustering coefficient is 0." },
  { front: "64. How do you calculate the global clustering coefficient of a network? Provide an example.", back: "The global clustering coefficient is the average of all nodes’ clustering coefficients or computed as (3 × number of triangles) / (number of connected triplets). If most nodes have a coefficient of 0, the global value will be 0." },
  { front: "65. How do you calculate the maximum possible number of edges in an undirected network? Provide an example.", back: "For n nodes, maximum edges = n(n – 1)/2. For example, if n = 10, then maximum edges = 10×9/2 = 45." },
  { front: "66. How do you calculate the average shortest path length of a network? Provide an example.", back: "First, calculate the shortest path between every pair of nodes. Sum all these shortest path lengths and then divide by the number of pairs. For example, if the total sum is 100 for 45 pairs (in a 10-node network), the average path length = 100/45 ≈ 2.222." }
