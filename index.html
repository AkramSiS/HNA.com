var flashcards = [
  { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-powered virtual characters used in social experiments, surveys, and interviews. They don’t just role-play; they can build profiles, remember past interactions, think about their behavior, and learn to make conversations more dynamic." },
  { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree counts the connections coming into a node (like how many followers you have), while outdegree counts the connections going out (like how many people you follow)." },
  { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality tells you how quickly a node can reach all other nodes. You add up the shortest distances from that node to everyone else and then take the inverse so that nodes closer to everyone score higher." },
  { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness centrality are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node sits on the shortest path between two other nodes. Nodes with high betweenness act like bridges, connecting different parts of the network and helping spread information." },
  { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it considered a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "While degree centrality simply counts direct connections, eigenvector centrality also considers the importance of a node’s neighbors. So, even with fewer connections, linking to influential nodes can make a node more important." },
  { front: "6. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "Barabási found that many networks, no matter their age or purpose, tend to have similar overall structures. In other words, different networks often share common building patterns." },
  { front: "7. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "They are the Erdös–Rényi model (random connections), the Small-world model (a regular structure with added shortcuts), and the Barabasi-Albert model (growing networks where new nodes prefer to connect with popular nodes)." },
  { front: "8. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "In the Gn,p model, you start with n nodes and each possible pair gets connected with a fixed probability p, chosen completely at random." },
  { front: "9. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "The Gn,M model creates a graph with n nodes and exactly M edges. The graph is randomly chosen from all possible graphs with these n nodes and M edges." },
  { front: "10. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures how well a network divides into groups or communities. Higher modularity means nodes inside a group are tightly connected, which helps reveal structures like social circles." },
  { front: "11. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "The BA model is based on two ideas: Growth (adding new nodes over time) and Preferential Attachment (new nodes are more likely to connect with nodes that already have many links)." },
  { front: "12. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant to social network analysis?", back: "The friendship paradox is the idea that on average, your friends tend to have more friends than you do. This happens because popular people appear in many friend lists, affecting how information spreads." },
  { front: "13. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They automatically find groups of nodes that interact more with each other than with the rest of the network, revealing hidden communities like friend circles." },
  { front: "14. What does the clustering coefficient measure in a network?", back: "It measures the chance that a node’s neighbors are also connected to each other. A high clustering coefficient means the node is part of a tight-knit group." },
  { front: "15. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are nodes with many connections. They serve as central intersections that keep the network connected and help spread information quickly." },
  { front: "16. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment means new nodes tend to connect with already popular nodes. This creates a few super-connected hubs while most nodes remain with only a few links." },
  { front: "17. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an Erdös–Rényi graph, the average number of steps between nodes grows roughly with the logarithm of the total number of nodes, so even large networks have relatively short paths." },
  { front: "18. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "They have a binomial degree distribution, which means most nodes have a number of connections near the average, with very few nodes having significantly more or less." },
  { front: "19. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "Small-world networks keep strong local connections (high clustering) while adding a few random long-range links that act as shortcuts, so you can easily travel across the network." },
  { front: "20. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness is about how well a network stays connected even when some nodes or links fail. A robust network keeps functioning even if parts of it break down." },
  { front: "21. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing highly connected hubs can quickly break the network into pieces. This shows that while scale-free networks can handle random failures, they’re very vulnerable if key hubs are attacked." },
  { front: "22. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the E-R Random Graph Model?", back: "No, specifying n and p doesn’t give you one specific graph. Many different graphs can be created with the same values because each edge is added randomly." },
  { front: "23. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "In an Erdös–Rényi graph, any two neighbors have a chance p of being connected, which usually results in a low overall clustering in the network." },
  { front: "24. Compared to the E-R Random Graph Model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks like film actors and C. elegans?", back: "Real-world networks often have short paths between nodes and high clustering, meaning that nodes tend to form tight groups." },
  { front: "25. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network according to the Watts-Strogatz model?", back: "It starts with a regular network (like a ring lattice where each node connects to its nearest neighbors), which has high clustering but long paths between distant nodes." },
  { front: "26. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model and what is its purpose?", back: "During rewiring, each edge has a chance to be randomly reconnected to a different node, creating shortcuts that reduce the distance between nodes." },
  { front: "27. What happens to the Small-world network when the rewire probability (pr) is 0? What happens when pr is 1?", back: "If pr is 0, no edges are rewired, so the network stays regular. If pr is 1, every edge is randomly rewired, making the network similar to an Erdös–Rényi random graph." },
  { front: "28. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and small average shortest path length?", back: "It starts with a regular network that has tight local groups and then adds a few random shortcuts, which greatly reduce the number of steps needed to connect any two nodes." },
  { front: "29. What type of degree distribution is typical for both E-R and Small-world networks?", back: "Both models usually show a binomial degree distribution, meaning most nodes have a number of connections close to the average with few extremes." },
  { front: "30. What is a key observation about the degree distribution of many real-world networks that is not captured by the E-R or Small-world models?", back: "In many real networks, only a few nodes (hubs) have lots of connections, while most nodes have very few. It’s like a party where only a few people are super popular, and the rest know only a few others—a pattern described by a power law." },
  { front: "31. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "The BA model creates a scale-free network, meaning it naturally develops a few highly connected hubs alongside many nodes with fewer connections." },
  { front: "32. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "In BA scale-free networks, the number of connections per node follows a power law. This means most nodes have few links, while a few hubs have many links, usually with an exponent around 3." },
  { front: "33. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "BA scale-free networks tend to have very short average path lengths—even shorter than random graphs—making it very easy to move from one node to another." },
  { front: "34. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks in real-world systems?", back: "The controversy is that 'scale-free' isn’t very clearly defined, and many real networks might not exactly follow the expected power law pattern. Sometimes, other models (like a log-normal distribution) may fit the data better." },
  { front: "35. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "The BA/SF model is meant to show how networks can naturally develop a few very connected hubs over time. It explains the process rather than exactly modeling a specific network." },
  { front: "36. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment in network growth models?", back: "In linear preferential attachment, a new node’s chance to connect to an existing node is directly proportional to that node’s current connections. In non-linear attachment, this relationship is changed, which can alter the number and size of hubs." },
  { front: "37. What are some modifications or variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world network properties?", back: "Improvements include non-linear preferential attachment (changing how strongly connections matter), setting a limit on the number of connections (degree cutoff), giving new nodes a boost (age correction), and focusing on local connections (local-world models)." },

  // New flashcards on contagion and social ties
  { front: "38. Simple Contagion", back: "A type of contagion where a single contact is enough for transmission. Think of it as catching a cold—one encounter can do it. It often spreads through weak ties." },
  { front: "39. Complex Contagion", back: "A type of contagion that requires multiple and reliable contacts before spreading. For example, changing your diet or joining a social movement might need reinforcement from several people, usually strong ties." },
  { front: "40. Weak Ties", back: "These are connections with distant friends, neighbours, or colleagues—people you don’t interact with often. They’re great for discovering new information, like job leads, as shown in Granovetter’s study." },
  { front: "41. Strong Ties", back: "These are your close connections, like family, close friends, or a partner. You interact with them frequently and they usually belong to the same tight group, providing strong support." },
  { front: "42. \"The Strength of Weak Ties\"", back: "A concept by Mark Granovetter (1973) showing that weak ties can be more valuable than strong ones for accessing new information, like job opportunities." },
  { front: "43. Diffusion Models", back: "These are numerical models used to explain how things spread in networks. Examples include the Independent Cascade Model, SIR (and its variants), and the Threshold Model." },
  { front: "44. Independent Cascade Model (IC Model)", back: "A model for simple contagion where nodes are either active or inactive. Once a node becomes active, it gets one chance to activate each neighbor with a certain probability, then it stops." },
  { front: "45. Seed Nodes", back: "These are the initial nodes activated at the start (time t=0) of the contagion process in the Independent Cascade Model." },
  { front: "46. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) Model", back: "A model where individuals can be Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered. Susceptible people can catch the infection from infected ones, and after a while, the infected recover." },
  { front: "47. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) Model", back: "A variant of the SIR model, often used for diseases like COVID-19, that adds an Exposed stage for those infected but not yet contagious." },
  { front: "48. Threshold Model", back: "A model for complex contagion where a person adopts a new behavior only if enough of their contacts have already done so." },
  { front: "49. Absolute Threshold", back: "A type of threshold model where a person needs a specific number of their contacts (T) to adopt a behavior before they do." },
  { front: "50. Linear Threshold Model", back: "A version of the threshold model where each contact has a weight, and a person adopts the behavior if the total weight from active contacts exceeds a set threshold." },
  { front: "51. Width of a Bridge", back: "This refers to the number of overlapping connections between two communities. A wider bridge means there are more shared ties, which helps spread complex behaviors." },
  { front: "52. Social Tipping Point", back: "The moment in a diffusion process when a behavior or idea starts spreading on its own, becoming self-sustaining." },
  { front: "53. Critical Mass", back: "The minimum portion of a population needed for a behavior to spread widely. Estimates vary, but it might be around 16% or sometimes between 5% and 40%." },
  { front: "54. How do viruses and information spread in social networks?", back: "They mainly spread through simple contagion, which is quick and often driven by weak ties passing on the message." },
  { front: "55. How do social change and risky behaviours spread in social networks?", back: "They usually spread through complex contagion, which requires reinforcement from several strong, reliable connections." },
  { front: "56. Can we capture the principles of contagion processes in numerical models?", back: "Yes, by understanding how something spreads and setting the right parameters, we can simulate the process using models like the IC, SIR, and Threshold models." }
