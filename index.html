    var flashcards = [
      { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-driven agents used for social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can create profiles, retain memory, reflect, and learn from interactions, enabling dynamic social simulations." },
      { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree is the number of incoming edges (e.g., number of followers on Twitter), while outdegree is the number of outgoing edges (e.g., number of people you follow)." },
      { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all others by summing the shortest path distances and taking the inverse." },
      { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness centrality are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. High values indicate key bridges that control information flow." },
      { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it considered a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "Degree centrality counts direct connections, whereas eigenvector centrality prioritizes connections to influential nodes, making it a better measure of overall influence." },
      { front: "6. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "The universality of the network topology, where many real networks converge to similar architectures regardless of their age, function, and scope." },
      { front: "7. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "The Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model, the Small-world Random Graph Model, and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model." },
      { front: "8. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "A graph with n nodes where each possible edge (u,v) appears independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a probability p." },
      { front: "9. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "A graph chosen uniformly randomly from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and M edges, where each edge is equally likely." },
      { front: "10. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures the strength of division of a network into modules or communities, helping in detecting real-world social structures." },
      { front: "11. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "Growth: new nodes are added to the network over time. Preferential attachment: new nodes are more likely to connect to existing nodes with higher degrees." },
      { front: "12. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant to social network analysis?", back: "The paradox states that most people have fewer friends than their friends have on average. This is relevant for influence spread and marketing strategies." },
      { front: "13. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They identify clusters or groups within a network, helping to understand hidden structures and social dynamics." },
      { front: "14. What does the clustering coefficient measure in a network?", back: "It measures the likelihood that a node’s neighbors are also connected, indicating the presence of tightly knit communities." },
      { front: "15. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are highly connected nodes that play a crucial role in information flow, resilience, and influence distribution in networks." },
      { front: "16. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment explains why some nodes become highly connected over time, forming hubs that dominate the network." },
      { front: "17. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "The average shortest path length is O(log N), where N is the number of nodes. This indicates that even large networks have short paths between nodes." },
      { front: "18. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "A binomial degree distribution." },
      { front: "19. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "Small-world networks maintain high clustering like regular networks but introduce short paths using a few long-range connections, improving efficiency." },
      { front: "20. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness refers to the ability of a network to maintain connectivity despite node or link failures, which is crucial for system resilience." },
      { front: "21. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing hubs drastically fragments the network, showing that scale-free networks are resilient to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks." }
