var flashcards = [
  { front: "1. What are LLM-driven social generative agents, and what capabilities do they possess beyond simply role-playing?", back: "They are AI-driven agents used for social experiments, surveys, and interviews. Beyond role-playing, they can create profiles, retain memory, reflect, and learn from interactions, enabling dynamic social simulations." },
  { front: "2. Explain the difference between indegree and outdegree in a directed network, providing an example.", back: "Indegree is the number of incoming edges (e.g., number of followers on Twitter), while outdegree is the number of outgoing edges (e.g., number of people you follow)." },
  { front: "3. Describe what closeness centrality measures and how it is calculated.", back: "Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all others by summing the shortest path distances and taking the inverse." },
  { front: "4. Explain the concept of betweenness centrality and why nodes with high betweenness centrality are significant.", back: "Betweenness centrality measures how often a node appears on the shortest paths between other nodes. High values indicate key bridges that control information flow." },
  { front: "5. How does eigenvector centrality differ from degree centrality, and why is it considered a measure of 'quality over quantity'?", back: "Degree centrality counts direct connections, whereas eigenvector centrality prioritizes connections to influential nodes, making it a better measure of overall influence." },
  { front: "6. According to Barabási, what is a surprising discovery of modern network theory?", back: "The universality of the network topology, where many real networks converge to similar architectures regardless of their age, function, and scope." },
  { front: "7. What are the three main network formation models discussed in the lecture?", back: "The Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model, the Small-world Random Graph Model, and the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model." },
  { front: "8. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,p.", back: "A graph with n nodes where each possible edge (u,v) appears independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a probability p." },
  { front: "9. Describe the Erdös–Rényi Random Graph Model denoted as Gn,M.", back: "A graph chosen uniformly randomly from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and M edges, where each edge is equally likely." },
  { front: "10. What is modularity in network analysis and why is it important?", back: "Modularity measures the strength of division of a network into modules or communities, helping in detecting real-world social structures." },
  { front: "11. What are the two main mechanisms involved in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model of network formation?", back: "Growth: new nodes are added to the network over time. Preferential attachment: new nodes are more likely to connect to existing nodes with higher degrees." },
  { front: "12. What is the 'friendship paradox' and why is it relevant to social network analysis?", back: "The paradox states that most people have fewer friends than their friends have on average. This is relevant for influence spread and marketing strategies." },
  { front: "13. How do community detection algorithms help in social network analysis?", back: "They identify clusters or groups within a network, helping to understand hidden structures and social dynamics." },
  { front: "14. What does the clustering coefficient measure in a network?", back: "It measures the likelihood that a node’s neighbors are also connected, indicating the presence of tightly knit communities." },
  { front: "15. Why are hubs important in scale-free networks?", back: "Hubs are highly connected nodes that play a crucial role in information flow, resilience, and influence distribution in networks." },
  { front: "16. What is the role of preferential attachment in scale-free networks?", back: "Preferential attachment explains why some nodes become highly connected over time, forming hubs that dominate the network." },
  { front: "17. What is the average shortest path length in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "The average shortest path length is O(log N), where N is the number of nodes. This indicates that even large networks have short paths between nodes." },
  { front: "18. What type of degree distribution does an Erdös–Rényi random graph have?", back: "A binomial degree distribution." },
  { front: "19. How do small-world networks balance efficiency and clustering?", back: "Small-world networks maintain high clustering like regular networks but introduce short paths using a few long-range connections, improving efficiency." },
  { front: "20. What is network robustness, and why is it important?", back: "Network robustness refers to the ability of a network to maintain connectivity despite node or link failures, which is crucial for system resilience." },
  { front: "21. What is the impact of removing hubs in a scale-free network?", back: "Removing hubs drastically fragments the network, showing that scale-free networks are resilient to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks." },
  { front: "22. Does specifying 'n' (number of nodes) and 'p' (probability of an edge) uniquely determine a graph in the E-R Random Graph Model?", back: "No, n and p do not uniquely determine the graph. Many different realizations are possible for the same n and p." },
  { front: "23. What is the expected mean local clustering coefficient in an Erdös–Rényi random graph?", back: "The expected mean local clustering coefficient is p, resulting in low clustering." },
  { front: "24. Compared to the E-R Random Graph Model, what are two key properties observed in many real-world networks like film actors and C. elegans?", back: "Short path length and high clustering." },
  { front: "25. What is the starting point for constructing a Small-world Network according to the Watts-Strogatz model?", back: "A completely regular network, often visualized as a ring lattice with high clustering and high diameter." },
  { front: "26. What is the 'rewiring' step in the Watts-Strogatz Small-world model and what is its purpose?", back: "For each edge, with a rewire probability (pr), one end is reconnected to a random node to introduce shortcuts and reduce the diameter." },
  { front: "27. What happens to the Small-world network when the rewire probability (pr) is 0? What happens when pr is 1?", back: "When pr = 0, the network remains the original regular network; when pr = 1, it becomes an E-R random graph." },
  { front: "28. How does the Small-world model achieve both high clustering and small average shortest path length?", back: "By starting with a regular network and adding a few random shortcuts that drastically reduce path lengths without destroying the clustering." },
  { front: "29. What type of degree distribution is typical for both E-R and Small-world networks?", back: "They both typically have a binomial degree distribution, where most nodes have a similar number of connections." },
  { front: "30. What is a key observation about the degree distribution of many real-world networks that is not captured by the E-R or Small-world models?", back: "The tail of the distribution often follows a power law, with few hubs and many nodes with few connections." },
  { front: "31. What type of network topology is generated by the Barabasi-Albert (BA) model?", back: "A scale-free network." },
  { front: "32. What is the characteristic degree distribution of a scale-free network generated by the BA model?", back: "A power law distribution (p(k) ~ k^(-γ)), typically with γ around 3." },
  { front: "33. How does the average path length in a BA scale-free network compare to that of a random graph?", back: "It's typically shorter, often referred to as an 'ultra small world'." },
  { front: "34. What is the main controversy surrounding the concept of 'scale-free' networks in real-world systems?", back: "There's no widely agreed rigorous definition, and strongly scale-free structures may be rare." },
  { front: "35. According to Barabási, what is the BA/SF model primarily intended to explain?", back: "It explains the mechanism behind the scale-free nature of networks rather than modeling a specific real-world network." },
  { front: "36. What is the key difference between linear and non-linear preferential attachment in network growth models?", back: "Linear attachment means the probability is directly proportional to degree, while non-linear attachment alters that relationship, affecting network structure." },
  { front: "37. What are some modifications or variants of the basic Barabasi-Albert model to better capture real-world network properties?", back: "Variants include non-linear preferential attachment, high degree cutoffs, age correction, and local-world evolving models." }
